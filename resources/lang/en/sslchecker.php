    "desc-5-1-2" => "Recording Protocol",
    "desc-5-1-2-1" => "Record Protocol is a work stage where the data encryption process takes place. Record Protocol is also known as record protocol because this protocol will store all types, versions and lengths of data that has been transmitted. Apart from that, the Record Protocol also provides digital signatures and message digest (MD) records relating to data security. At this point, the validation process between the client and server takes place.",
    "desc-5-1-3" => "Warning Protocol",
    "desc-5-1-3-1" => "SSL can filter or filter data that has been submitted by the client at this point. This protocol will select data from clients that are considered suspicious or do not meet standards. If an error occurs during the data transmission process, the server will automatically send an error warning message. Warnings issued by servers are usually divided into 3 types, namely warning signs, critical alerts, and finally fatal alerts.",

    "desc-6-3-1" => "Choosing a certificate should be in line with the needs of the website. Determine the purpose or goals of the website before deciding on a type of certificate.
