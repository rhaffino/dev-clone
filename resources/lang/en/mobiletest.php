    "desc-1" => "What is cmlabs Mobile Friendly Test?",
    "desc-1-1" => "Having a mobile-friendly site is a fundamental part of your online brand awareness. In many countries, mobile traffic currently exceeds desktop traffic. If you haven't made your site well portable, you should. CMLABS's Mobile Friendly Test Tool is a quick and simple approach to testing whether the pages on your site are mobile friendly.",
    "desc-2" => "How to Use This Tool",
    "desc-2-1" => "The Mobile-Friendly Test is not at all difficult to use; basically type in the full URL of the site page you need to test. Each sidetrack the page runs will be followed by testing. The test usually takes a short time to run.",
    "desc-2-2" => "The test results included screenshots of how the page was displayed on Google on the phone, along with other issues it found. Mobile preview issues can affect clients visiting pages on portable gadgets (small screens), including small text dimensions (which are difficult to read on small screens) and Flash usage (which most phones don't support).",
    "desc-2-3" => "When the web page cannot be reached",
    "desc-2-3-1" => "If the Mobile Friendly Test tool can't open the page, it will show an error describing the problem. Access issues include system availability issues or site downtime.",
    "desc-2-3-2" => "This Mobile Friendly test tool opens the page as Googlebot (that is, not using your qualifications, but as Google). This implies that it is likely to be blocked by the robots.txt document.",
    "desc-2-4" => "When the page contains unmountable elements",
    "desc-2-4-1" => "If the test can't stack all the elements used by the page, you'll get a notification. Resources are external components included by a page, for example, images, CSS, or script files. This can happen for several reasons:",
    "desc-2-4-1-1" => "The element cannot be loaded in a reasonable size of time. For this situation, try running the test again. If that continues, consider facilitating the element elsewhere, or, in all likelihood, try to find and correct the explanation behind the no-response from the host.",

    "desc-2-5" => "Unblocks significant resources",
    "desc-2-5-1" => "If the assets being blocked are very significant, they can greatly affect how Google understands the page. For example, a large blocked image can cause a page to appear mobile-friendly when it is not. Or a blocked CSS document can cause misunderstanding of the text styles to be applied (for example, the size is too small for the gadget). This affects Google's mobile-friendly score and capacity to crawl your pages. You must ensure that critical elements are not blocked by Googlebot by robots.txt and are available.",

    "desc-2-6-1" => "If you have an unloaded element or other pileup issue, you may see slightly different results each time you run the test. That's because the stacked resource settings can be different during each test. If you see your page making changes every time you run the test, and you haven't changed anything, check the \"page loading issues\" note; if applicable, click for more information to find out what might happen to prevent the page from being delivered reliably and effectively.",
    "desc-3" => "Mobile Usability Error",

    "desc-3-1-1-1" => "If your page uses a plugin, for example, Flash, which is not supported by portable devices, we recommend overhauling your page to start using modern, widely supported web technologies, for example, HTML5.",
    "desc-3-1-2" => "2. Viewport not adjusted",
    "desc-3-1-2-1" => "The page doesn't characterize the viewport property, which tells the browser how to change the sizing and scaling of the page to fit the screen size. Since visitors to your site use a variety of gadgets with different screen sizes - from large workspace screens, to small tablets and phones - your page must define the viewport with the meta viewport tag.",
    "desc-3-1-3" => "3. Content wider than screen",
    "desc-3-1-3-1" => "Horizontal scrolling is important for seeing words and images on the page. This occurs when the page uses absolute values ​​in CSS, or uses an image that is meant to view a specific browser width, (for example, 980px). To fix this error, make sure the page uses relative width and position values ​​for the CSS component, and make sure that the image is scalable as well.",
    "desc-3-1-4" => "4. Text too small to read",
    "desc-3-1-4-1" => "This is an error that occurs when the text font size for the page is too small and will require the user to \"squeeze to zoom\" to read. After setting the viewport for your page, set the font size for your text to an appropriate scale within the viewport.",
    "desc-3-1-5" => "5. Clickable elements are too close together",
    "desc-3-1-5-1" => "Linkable components, for example, buttons and link text with links, are so close that it takes a significant amount of effort for mobile clients to tap the ideal component with their finger without tapping adjacent components. To fix this error, make sure to estimate accurately and the spacing and link buttons to be suitable for your mobile users.",
    "whats-new-1"=>"In the latest version of this Mobile-Friendly tool, we added a Robot Progress Bar. This robot is useful for seeing what percentage of crawling process. This update will make it easier for developers to get work done in less time without wasting time checking manually.",
    "whats-new-2"=>"Now, with the latest version of the Mobile-Friendly tool, users can see a website that can be checked by mobile. This update provides advantages for you in the process of creating a website with one tool that has various functions already. With this latest version, you no longer have to worry about deadlines.
