    "desc-1-1"=>"The first thing you need to understand is that you cannot post jobs to Google directly. The word \"job posting\" is therefore a little misleading. Instead, here's how everything else works: You post a job listing on your site and use Structured Data so Google (and other search engines) know that the page is about Job Posting.",
    "desc-1-2"=>"First of all, let's see how we can build a job post on our site:",
    "desc-2"=>"Write about a job",
    "desc-2-1"=>"The first thing you have to do is write about a job and publish it. In WordPress you will create a new post, page or custom post type (possibly via a third party Job Posting plugin).",
    "desc-2-2"=>"Now you have a post about work. However, as you may know, from my Structured Data Training, Google can only guess whether the page contains job posts. For this purpose, you need Structured Data.",
    "desc-3"=>"Add Structured Data for Job Posting",
    "desc-3-1"=>"Next you need to add Structured Data to your blog posts. The Google reference for JobPosting tells us which schema.org schema we need to use (it is JobPosting) and what properties are required to include the job posting in search results.",
    "desc-3-2"=>"Don't be afraid of the code snippets I'll show you below. If you take a closer look, you'll find that we only have key-value pairs here:",
    "desc-4"=>"Use a WordPress editor",
    "desc-4-1"=>"If you only offer one job, you can copy this code and paste it into your WordPress editor. If you are using the new block editor (\"Gutenberg\") in WordPress, you can simply add an \"HTML\" block and copy the above code into it.",
    "desc-4-2"=>"Don't forget to change the values ​​and use your own!",
    "highlight"=>"In this latest version of the Job Posting Schema Generator tool in JSON LD, you can create a so-called Global Snippet and attach it to all your work pages automatically. You can also preview. This will help you to see how your Job Posting will appear in search engines. This allows you to do some editing before uploading to search engines. We hope that this tool will help you find candidates according to specifications.",

With this, your job posting will be more optimized and will appear on Google's Rich Snippet. We hope that with this tool, you can post jobs to Google directly and optimally.",
